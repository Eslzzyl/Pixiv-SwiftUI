## Special Thanks

- [pixez-flutter](https://github.com/Notsfsssf/pixez-flutter): This project is the main reference, with many API and UI designs referenced from it. pixez-flutter is an excellent project. Unfortunately, the abnormal heating issue on iOS devices remained unresolved for a long time, which was the main motivation for this project.
- [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher): Provides image loading and caching.
- [TranslationKit](https://github.com/Eslzzyl/TranslationKit): Provides translation interfaces, also a completely Vibe Coding project.
- [GzipSwift](https://github.com/1024jp/GzipSwift): Direct connection mode manually implemented HTTP protocol; GzipSwift provides gzip decompression.
- [Immersive Translate](https://immersivetranslate.com/): Inspired the translation function of this project.
- [pixivpy](https://github.com/upbit/pixivpy): Provided API references.
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/): Models provided for free by the OpenCode Zen plan implemented most of the code for this project.
- [iFlow CLI](https://cli.iflow.cn/): Free models provided participated in the implementation of the project.

The current lead programmer is GLM-5. Other models involved in development include: Kimi K2.5, GLM 4.6, GLM 4.7, Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok Code Fast 1, GPT-5.2, GPT-5.2-Codex.
